Build a Book Finder App using React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

Requirements:

The app is for a college student named Alex who wants to search for books easily.

https://openlibrary.org/search.json?title={bookTitle}

Features:

A search bar where Alex can type a book title and either press Enter or click Search.

Fetch results from the API and display them in a responsive grid of book cards.

Each book card should show:

Cover image (or a placeholder if missing).

Book title.

Author(s).

First publish year.

Show a loading spinner while fetching results.

Show "No results found" if nothing matches.

Handle API errors gracefully.

UI / Styling:

Use TailwindCSS for styling.

Mobile-first responsive design.

Cards with rounded corners, shadows, and hover effects.

Bonus (if time allows):

Add pagination or infinite scroll.

Add filters by author or year.
